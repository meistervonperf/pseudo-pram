This kernel module implements a pseudo persistent memory (pseudo-PRAM), 
which can be used with NVM-logging implemented in PostgreSQL. 
It is 'pseudo' PRAM as it stores data in a DRAM area allocated at the module 
insertion. The contents in the pseudo-PRAM does not survive power failure 
but survives any failure occurred at application programs including PostgreSQL.

Usage: insmod ppram.ko [num=N] [type=0 or 1]
where N is the number of 16 Megabyte-sized WAL segments, and type specifies 
the cache mode (0:write-combined, 1:uncached) for the segments.
A device file (/dev/pseudo-pram) that supports read() and mmap() will be 
created as a result of the module insertion.

Note: To permit the access to the device file for PostgreSQL users, 
the device file permission have to be changed. If you use RHEL7 (or CenOS7), 
the most convenient way is probably creating the rule file named 
/etc/udev/rules.d/99-ppram that contains the following line at first, 
and then execute the insmod command.
