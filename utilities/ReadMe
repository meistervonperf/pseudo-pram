These are utility programs for pseudo PRAM, consisting of ppramRead ppramClear.

"ppramRead" shows the data in the device file (/dev/pseudo-pram) 
in a human-readable text-format. This command takes no option parameter.

"ppramClear" zero-clears the pseudo PRAM, which may be necessary in some ill 
situation; for example, the $PGDATA directory is repeatedly restored from 
the same tar file, which makes to a situation where the same system identifier, 
indicating when the $PGDATA was created by initdb command, of the database is 
used without the continuity of the LSN (Log Sequence Number). 
This command takes one option parameter to specify the size of the pseudo PRAM 
in the unit of WAL segments. The default value is 4 which corresponds that 
the pseudo PRAM size is 64 Megabytes.
